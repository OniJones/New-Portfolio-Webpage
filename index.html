          <h3> About Bobby </h3>
          
          <p> Problem solving has always been a passion of mine. I've taken several classes in programming and learned that it is definitely the career field where I belong. I love playing video games, like Final Fantasy XIV, where I am able to join groups of people to solve issues in its vast worlds. Maybe one day I can combine the hobbies into a full blown profession. </p>
          
          <p> Although I have taken other classes, I have never felt as close to my goals than whenI started under the tutelage of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"> Thinkful </a></p>
          
          <p> If you are looking to hire a developer that loves working in teams, search no further! I would absolutely love to work with other developers to see what new joys we can bring the world! </p>
